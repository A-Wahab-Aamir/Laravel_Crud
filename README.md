Laravel is a popular PHP framework for building modern and dynamic web applications in today’s fast-paced and ever-evolving web development landscape. One of its core features is Laravel Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables developers to efficiently perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a database.

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform these operations in your Laravel application using Laravel’s Eloquent ORM and how to deploy your Laravel CRUD application using MyKinsta.

CRUD Functionality in Laravel
CRUD operations are the backbone of any database-driven application. They allow you to perform the most basic and essential database operations, such as creating new records, reading existing ones, and updating and deleting them. These operations are crucial to the functionality of any Laravel application that interacts with a database.

Eloquent provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the database by decreasing the complexities of database management so that you can focus on building your application. Its built-in methods and classes enable you to easily CRUD records in the database.
